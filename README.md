Hi, I'm Krithi. I'm a CS major enamored with learning about different niches– artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning– and how they develop solutions to real-world problems. 

``` Ultimately, the creativity associated with innovative solutions defines my hunger for discovery and passion for computer science. ```
