Hi, I'm Krithi. I am a current computer science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am enamored with learning about different niches– artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning– and how they develop solutions to real-world problems. Ultimately, the creativity associated with innovative solutions defines my hunger for discovery and passion for computer science.
